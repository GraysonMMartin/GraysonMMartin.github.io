I am a recent graduate of Harvard University where I studied computer science and applied mathematics. My interests broadly lie in perception & decision-making, especially when applied to robotics, natural agents, and healthcare.

My background spans data science, optimization, reinforcement learning, geometric machine learning, signals and communications, control theory, computer vision, and high-performance computing. My work includes robotics rapid prototyping at Los Alamos National Laboratory and NeuroAI research at The Kempner Institute. I also co-founded Medentum Innovations, where we continue to work toward making high-quality healthcare more accessible to rural Americans through medical devices & AI.
